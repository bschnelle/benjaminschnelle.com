# Blog From Scratch

This idea has been bouncing around my head for a long time, but one thing I've always struggled with is just getting started. I'm somewhat of a perfectionist which can be a hinderance when it comes to achieving my goals, but this evening I decided to just get started and stop worrying about how well it turns out. 

What I'm going to do is build a blog from scratch where the only thing I can use is virtual machines such as AWS EC2, Go, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In order to get this thing running quickly I'm going to allow myself to use the Go `net/http` package from the standard library, but plan to replace that with my own web server implementation eventually. Beyond that I plan to write my own markdown parser and all of the other things that go into a delightful blog. I haven't put much thought into exactly what will and won't be allowed, but the plan is to write my own implementation of as many of the things that I typically take for granted when building a web application as possible.

It's 7:41pm and I'm planning to get this thing live tonight so I better get started!
